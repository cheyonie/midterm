        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="p">My name is Chey and I will be your braider! I am originally from California
        and that is where my journey of braiding began. I was a 6th grader at Washington Elementary 
        School creating designs in my friend's hair for fun! I am located on the southwest side in a luxury 
        suite. Punctuality is extremely important to me, so I have a starting time guarantee. If any changes 
        need to occur, I will provide you with more than a 24 hour notice. With my promise, I hope that you 
        will be able to provide me the same! Please do not schedule anything important the day of your important.
        Quality means the world to me, so I would like to make sure I am able to focus on giving you a beautiful
        style without feeling rushed!
